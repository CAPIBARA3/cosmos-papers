# Program Concept outline:

# COSMOS: COnstellation of Student-Made high energy ObservatorieS

# Phase 0: Foundation

* Establish CAPIBARA as a credible professional student collaboration: institutional backup (advisory council), MCD, scientific papers


# Phase 1 Pathfinder: COSMOS-1 (2026-2028/29)

* Research existing, proven CubeSat gamma-ray detectors (GRBAlpha/CAMELOT/BurstCube). Build upon that and improve the next generation of those type of missions. Contact their teams and propose collaboration/advise.
* Apply to programs: ESA's Fly Your Satellite! or NASA's CSLI for funding and launch: "We are an international student consortium proposing to build and operate GRBAlpha-2, a technology demonstrator for a future all-sky monitor. This will provide invaluable hands-on experience for 50+ students across Europe and train the next generation of space scientists."
* Gain engineering and design skills and technical expertise from building this pathfinder.
* Build in university clean room, 3-5 MoUs


# Phase 2 Bridge: COSMOS-DuoO (2029-2032/33)

* Two ~30kg microsatellites (12-24 U Cubesats)
* Instruments: miniaturized, large are GAGG(Ce) detector array develop from COSMOS-1 experience.
* Science goals: demonstrate triangulation of ~20 sources/year, providing sub arcdegree localisation in <10 seconds after alert
* Funding: ESA's Scout, NASA's Astrophysics Pioneers, ERC Proof of Concept, Philantrophic Foundations (high-risk, high-reward)
* 5-10 university/institutional MoUs, each developing a subsystem (comms, payload, science software)


# Phase 3 Constellation: COSMOS-NET (2032-2035)

* Goal: Launch an operational high energy sky monitoring constellation
* Mission: 4 microsatellites in LEO, joining COSMOS-Duo providing continuous all-sky coverage, arcminute-level triangulation and serving as the high-energy trigger for the 2035 multi-messenger observatory network.
* Funding: $30-50M, ESA's Cosmic Vision, NASA's MIXED, ESA's M-class


# Revised timeline for CAPIBARA-COSMOS

* 2025: Finish MCD. Formalize CAPIBARA-COSMOS team.
* 2026: Secure partnership with an existing CubeSat team (e.g., GRBAlpha). Submit proposal to ESA's Fly Your Satellite! for COSMOS-1.
* 2027-2028: Build, test, and launch COSMOS-1. Get first light curve from space.
* 2029: Based on COSMOS-1 success, propose SENTINEL-Duo to ESA Scout/NASA Pioneers.
* 2030-2032: Develop and launch SENTINEL-Duo. Achieve satellite triangulation of a GRB.
* 2033: Propose the full COSMOS-NET constellation as an ESA M-class or NASA MIDEX mission.
* 2035: Launch.
